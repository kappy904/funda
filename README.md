<h2 align="center">Angular 11 + Scully JAMstack</h2>

This project is my assignment that has explored many concepts that include Async data with Observables, Object/Array destructuring, Content Projection (Transclusion), Intersection Observe for lazy loading, DRY components, SCSS architecture, Minimalism in Design, CSS3 Animations, mobile-first responsive fluid design and Scully static site generator for Angular. 


## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
Please make sure you have a CORS plugin as the Api has not whitelisted localhost domains. Please use device emulation for mobile as there are touch events.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Scully Build

Run `npm run scully` AFTER you have a fresh ng build. The artifacts are stored in the `dist/static` folder. Always deploy the static site to production.
